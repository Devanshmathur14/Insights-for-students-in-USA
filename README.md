# Insights-for-students-in-USA
Project base on admission related data for universities of USA.
Most American institutions (that are not necessarily the top 10-20) that provide undergraduate education face a challenge i.e. what kind of students they will make an offer for admission so that they can maintain a good performance in terms of number of students completing their courses in time. They also need to predict how the current batch of intake will perform. The universities cannot relax the entry criteria too much as that way the quality of education that they provide gets diluted. 

At the other hand, they have to make offers to the candidates who are not only having appropriate profile but are also most likely to accept the offers.
On the other side, the students have a challenge deciding which colleges they should apply i.e. the colleges that provide best performance at a minimal cost given their own profiles. The student profile is determined by not only the performance in examination such as SAT and ACT, but also other data points such as their ethnicity, immigration status, gender etc.
